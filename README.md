# Do not repeat yourself

This will be a place o summarize all the repeat things I do regularly, and try to make them automatically. 

1. [A crawler to crawl USCIS info and send SMS notification](https://github.com/dylan-shao/serverless-lambda-crawler-uscis)

2. [A jupyter notebook config to create a README.md after you save your notebook](https://github.com/dylan-shao/jupyter2README.md-auto-create-hook)

More coming....
