# Do not repeat myself

Summarize things I do repeatly, to make myself DRY. 

1. [A crawler to crawl USCIS info and send SMS notification (**Serverless, Lambda**)](https://github.com/dylan-shao/serverless-lambda-crawler-uscis)

2. [Automatically create a README.md after you save your Jupyter notebook (**jupyter config**)](https://github.com/dylan-shao/jupyter2README.md-auto-create-hook)

3. [Automatically create README.md tables when you commit (**node fs module**)](https://github.com/dylan-shao/Algorithms/blob/master/README.md)

4. I am eating 3 meals a day :robot:
