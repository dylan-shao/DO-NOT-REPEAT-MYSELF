Summarize things I do repeatly, to make myself DRY. 

1. [A crawler to crawl USCIS info and send SMS notification](https://github.com/dylan-shao/serverless-lambda-crawler-uscis)

2. [Automatically create a README.md after you save your Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/dylan-shao/jupyter2README.md-auto-create-hook)

3. I am eating 3 meals a day :wink:
